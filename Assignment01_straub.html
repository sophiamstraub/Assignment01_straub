        My experience with HTML and CSS mostly comes from WRA 210. I am comfortable with using sources
        and references to build HTML and CSS documents, but I am far from proficient. In my accessibility
        internship with MSU Libraries, I often studied the accessibility of the source code of websites, 
        so that gave me some insight into using HTML for important things like alt text and proper heading
        hierarchy.

    From this class, I hope to better understand the systems behind HTML and CSS. Rather than copying
    and pasting source code, I would like to be able to come up with my own solutions. Although I do not
    plan to go into web development, as a UX designer, it will certainly be helpful to have a solid
    foundation of HTML and CSS when it comes time to work with developers.
